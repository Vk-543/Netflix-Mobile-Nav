This project implements a responsive mobile navigation menu inspired by Netflix's website. The navigation menu is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it provides an interactive and aesthetically pleasing experience for users on mobile devices.

Features
Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile screens, providing an intuitive layout for smaller devices.
Expandable Navigation: Includes submenus for additional categories, such as "Life at Netflix," with expandable/collapsible items.
Interactive Animations: Smooth opening and closing transitions for the navigation menu.
Cross-platform Compatibility: Works seamlessly on modern browsers and devices.
Project Files
index.html: The HTML file contains the structure of the navigation menu and the placeholders for menu items and links.
style.css: The CSS file handles the styling and animations, giving the menu its visual appeal.
script.js: The JavaScript file manages the interactive behavior of the navigation, such as toggling the menu visibility.
How It Works
HTML Structure:

The index.html file defines a sidebar navigation with expandable sections and links.
A close button is implemented to hide the menu when not in use.
CSS Styling:

The menu and its items are styled with Netflixâ€™s branding, including the characteristic red and black color palette.
Animations are applied for smooth transitions when opening or closing the menu.
JavaScript Functionality:

Toggles the visibility of the menu using event listeners for the open and close buttons.
Handles submenu expand/collapse actions for nested items like "Life at Netflix."
